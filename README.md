1.An app that helps the voter to choose their candidate.The information on the voter id can be used so that the candidates present in the region of the voter are displayed prominently.This will include the educational qualifications,assets,criminal record etc.All thses things will be displayed in an additional comparitive page for each region so it is easier for each voter to decide amongst the candidates rather than having to o through each acndidates page individually and manually compare them. 
    FOR ALL CANDIDATES:They must provide all their information for the voters to browse through.All goverment records must be cross verified using smart contracts. 
   ONLY INCUMBENT CANDIDATES/WHO HAVE BEEN IN POWER IN THE PAST:There is noway (as of now) to see how the representative has voted on certain bills in the past 5 years.In the lok sabha/rajya sabha whenever any bill is put up for debate,the reprenetatives will use an app to record the final decision i.e YES/NO from the representative with an option to add comments,now this information must be stored on a blockchain.
    When the voter logs in on the app to vote he/she will be able to see the bills passed in the past 5 years,the candidate's vote and their comments(if any),this will help them make a more calculated decision.The app will also take a finger print scan of the representative when he enters the lok/rajya sabha so the voter will also be able to see how many sessions the candidate has been present in the sabha.
    the main idea behind this app is to increase the accountability of the candidates.the voter can see metrics to compare between the candidates which has to be done manually by going through each and every candidate's page right now. 

2.A list of all eligible voters is provided,each voter is considered as a node.Each node is allowed to cast only one vote.The biometrics information collected durig the aadhar procedure can be used to verify the same.The government archives can be used to dynamically remove the voter anytime a death occurs as it is mandotory to report a death 21 days after occurance.The network must be connected to police stations over the country so whenever a missing persons report is logded the node is deactivcated till confirmation arrives.The Blockcahin This will prevent double voting
App will be built on ethereum using solidity.
